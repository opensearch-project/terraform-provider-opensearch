# opensearch_cluster_settings (Resource)

Manages a cluster's (persistent) settings.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "opensearch_cluster_settings" "global" {
  cluster_max_shards_per_node = 10
  action_auto_create_index    = "my-index-000001,index10,-index1*,+ind*"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `action_auto_create_index` (String) Whether to automatically create an index if it doesn’t already exist and apply any configured index template
- `action_destructive_requires_name` (Boolean) When set to true, you must specify the index name to delete an index and it is not possible to delete all indices with _all or use wildcards
- `cluster_blocks_read_only` (Boolean) Make the whole cluster read only and metadata is not allowed to be modified
- `cluster_blocks_read_only_allow_delete` (Boolean) Make the whole cluster read only, but allows to delete indices to free up resources
- `cluster_indices_close_enable` (Boolean) If false, you cannot close open indices
- `cluster_info_update_interval` (String) A time string controlling how often Opensearch should check on disk usage for each node in the cluster
- `cluster_max_shards_per_node` (Number) The total number of primary and replica shards for the cluster, this number is multiplied by the number of non-frozen data nodes; shards for closed indices do not count toward this limit
- `cluster_max_shards_per_node_frozen` (Number) The total number of primary and replica frozen shards, for the cluster; Ssards for closed indices do not count toward this limit, a cluster with no frozen data nodes is unlimited.
- `cluster_no_master_block` (String) Specifies which operations are rejected when there is no active master in a cluster (all, write)
- `cluster_persistent_tasks_allocation_enable` (String) Whether allocation for persistent tasks is active (all, none)
- `cluster_persistent_tasks_allocation_recheck_interval` (String) A time string controling how often assignment checks are performed to react to whether persistent tasks can be assigned to nodes
- `cluster_routing_allocation_allow_rebalance` (String) Specify when shard rebalancing is allowed (always, indices_primaries_active, indices_all_active)
- `cluster_routing_allocation_awareness_attributes` (String) Use custom node attributes to take hardware configuration into account when allocating shards
- `cluster_routing_allocation_balance_index` (Number) Weight factor for the number of shards per index allocated on a node, increasing this raises the tendency to equalize the number of shards per index across all nodes
- `cluster_routing_allocation_balance_shard` (Number) Weight factor for the total number of shards allocated on a node, increasing this raises the tendency to equalize the number of shards across all nodes
- `cluster_routing_allocation_balance_threshold` (Number) Minimal optimization value of operations that should be performed, raising this will cause the cluster to be less aggressive about optimizing the shard balance
- `cluster_routing_allocation_cluster_concurrent_rebalance` (Number) How many concurrent shard rebalances are allowed cluster wide
- `cluster_routing_allocation_disk_include_relocations` (Boolean) Whether the allocator will take into account shards that are currently being relocated to the target node when computing a node’s disk usage
- `cluster_routing_allocation_disk_threshold_enabled` (Boolean) Whether the disk allocation decider is active
- `cluster_routing_allocation_disk_watermark_high` (String) Allocator will attempt to relocate shards away from a node whose disk usage is above this percentage disk used
- `cluster_routing_allocation_disk_watermark_low` (String) Allocator will not allocate shards to nodes that have more than this percentage disk used
- `cluster_routing_allocation_enable` (String) Enable or disable allocation for specific kinds of shards (all, primaries, new_primaries, none)
- `cluster_routing_allocation_node_concurrent_incoming_recoveries` (Number) How many incoming recoveries where the target shard (likely the replica unless a shard is relocating) are allocated on the node
- `cluster_routing_allocation_node_concurrent_outgoing_recoveries` (Number) How many outgoing recoveries where the source shard (likely the primary unless a shard is relocating) are allocated on the node
- `cluster_routing_allocation_node_concurrent_recoveries` (Number) A shortcut to set both incoming and outgoing recoveries
- `cluster_routing_allocation_node_initial_primaries_recoveries` (Number) Set a (usually) higher rate for primary recovery on node restart (usually from disk, so fast)
- `cluster_routing_allocation_same_shard_host` (Boolean) Perform a check to prevent allocation of multiple instances of the same shard on a single host, if multiple nodes are started on the host
- `cluster_routing_allocation_total_shards_per_node` (Number) Maximum number of primary and replica shards allocated to each node
- `cluster_routing_rebalance_enable` (String) Allow rebalancing for specific kinds of shards (all, primaries, replicas, none)
- `indices_breaker_fielddata_limit` (String) The percentage of memory above which if loading a field into the field data cache would cause the cache to exceed this limit, an error is returned
- `indices_breaker_fielddata_overhead` (Number) A constant that all field data estimations are multiplied by
- `indices_breaker_request_limit` (String) The percentabge of memory above which per-request data structures (e.g. calculating aggregations) are prevented from exceeding
- `indices_breaker_request_overhead` (Number) A constant that all request estimations are multiplied by
- `indices_breaker_total_limit` (String) The percentage of total amount of memory that can be used across all breakers
- `indices_recovery_max_bytes_per_sec` (String) Maximum total inbound and outbound recovery traffic for each node, in mb
- `network_breaker_inflight_requests_limit` (String) The percentage limit of memory usage on a node of all currently active incoming requests on transport or HTTP level
- `network_breaker_inflight_requests_overhead` (Number) A constant that all in flight requests estimations are multiplied by
- `script_max_compilations_rate` (String) Limit for the number of unique dynamic scripts within a certain interval that are allowed to be compiled, expressed as compilations divided by a time string
- `search_default_search_timeout` (String) A time string setting a cluster-wide default timeout for all search requests

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
