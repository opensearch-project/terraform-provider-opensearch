export OSS_IMAGE="opensearchproject/opensearch:2"
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps -a
export OPENSEARCH_URL=http://admin:admin@localhost:9200
export TF_LOG=INFO
TF_ACC=1 go test ./... -v -parallel 20 -cover -short
```

### Debugging this provider

Build the executable, and start in debug mode:

```console
$ go build
$ ./terraform-provider-opensearch -debuggable # or start in debug mode in your IDE
{"@level":"debug","@message":"plugin address","@timestamp":"2022-05-17T10:10:04.331668+01:00","address":"/var/folders/32/3mbbgs9x0r5bf991ltrl3p280010fs/T/plugin1346340234","network":"unix"}
Provider started, to attach Terraform set the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS env var:

        TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/opensearch-project/opensearch":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":79075,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/32/3mbbgs9x0r5bf991ltrl3p280010fs/T/plugin1346340234"}}}'
```

In another terminal, you can test your terraform code:

```console
$ cd <my-project/terraform>
$ export TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS=<env var above>
$ terraform apply
```

The local provider will be used instead, and you should see debug information printed to the terminal.
